# Livestock Management Server

This project involves developing a backend server for an application to be used on iOS and Android platforms. The server will host a database that stores comprehensive information about livestock, specifically large farm animals. This includes data on each animal's health records, feeding schedules, breeding history, and other relevant details. The server will handle data requests from the mobile applications, ensuring secure, reliable, and efficient access to the information. This backend system is crucial for farmers and livestock managers to monitor and manage their animals effectively.
